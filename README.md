# MiTurboFix

SA:MP RCE fixes. Contributions are welcome!
Versions: All from SA:MP 0.3.7 to 0.3DL

If you notice a bug, shitty code, or something else and know how to fix it, don't be shy and send a Pull Request!

This is **public domain SA:MP RCE's fix**. From people's for the people! Without clogging the chat when initializing ``CNetGame`` with copyrights "what is person who did this".

It is also possible to send the patch completely **ANONYMOUSLY**. You can send it to me at admin@noob-rp.com or to the maintainers' email (if they appear). Anonymity is **GUARANTEED**, if you, for example, work for some ******* RP SA:MP servers who deny developers make fixes for public domain for the sake of personal gain, and do not want to show that you are doing something for the people, and not privatizing a fix for some project. If you want to do a G-dly thing - welcome.
